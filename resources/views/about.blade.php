            As you may know by now, I am Lauren Shockley, the author, designer, and administrator of this very website you are currently on. Thank you again for dedicating some precious time out of your day to learn more about me. 
            
            I am currently a full-time student pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in Cybersecurity at Kennesaw State University, with a specialization in systems security, and an independent focus on penetration testing.
            
            My working background mainly consists of administrative work at joint Accounting and CPA Firms across the Greater Atlanta area, and is also something I am very proud of. Working in a finance-adjacent field has been extremely useful inside and out of pursuing a technical career. I also recently completed an information technology internship at the long standing J.M. Huber Corporation. You can learn more about my experience on the <a href="/resume" class="font-medium text-[#865DFF] hover:text-[#e5ff00] underline">Resume</a> page. 
            
            When my time is free I very much enjoy reading and expanding my current skill sets. My go-to is always a fiction/fantasy read, but it’s pretty hard to go wrong with a good murder-mystery if you ask me. Besides literature, most recently I’ve been focusing on my language fluency for the web (like this website; e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) and also data-related languages (Python, R).
            
            Over the past few years, systems and security has overtaken my life in the best way possible, and it has been wonderful to learn about things I never even knew existed in the past and experience so many new opportunities through this field; it has truly been transformative. Some of my daily drivers and favorite things to learn are different Linux distributions, server security, vulnerabilities/exploits, security applications/software, and network hardening. 
            
            Ultimately, I have a great passion for expanding my knowledge base with anything tech related and it is genuinely one of my favorite things to do. If you think you may have an opportunity, idea, or position that fits my skills and interests, please do not hesitate to reach out!
            
            The <a href="/contact" class="font-medium text-[#865DFF] hover:text-[#e5ff00] underline">Contact</a> page of this website has a fillable form that shoots me a message directly with who you are, and what you’d like to say. It's simple, quick, and designed to be user friendly, so go give it a try! I’ll always reply as soon as I can!
